Repo for 2022 Talk:  A Script Kiddie's Guide to Easy Wins

Yo!  Thanks for attending/supporting my talk at Cyphercon 2022!  Here's a quick breakdown of the files in this repo:

### Autohotkey File:
ahk.ahk is an example autohotkey file containing the goodies I use on the regular.  I've tried to comment on every function/one-shot command I've built, so hopefully, it'd be easy to follow.  Look for lines that begin with a ";" - those are the comments that explain what the command does.

### DuckyScript Stuff:
Everything else represents the files that sit on my duckypad.  You can drop all the files/folders as-is (minus ahk.ahk) into a duckypad's micro-sd card, and it should run the same as mine.  Within each key's .txt file, you ought to find a line that begins with "REM".  Those are the comments (remarks) that break down when and where to use a script, along with its intended outcome.
